      <description><![CDATA[
        I went from scrolling 4+ hours a day on social media to under 35 minutes.<br/><br/>
        Here’s exactly how I did it.<br/><br/>
        Scrolling endlessly used to be my biggest time waster. I would open Instagram to check a message and suddenly lose two hours to the dopamine hits of the algorithm 😭<br/><br/>
        <b>When you do the math, it's wild</b><br/>
        4 hours a day = 56 full days a year wasted on doomscrolling.<br/>
        That's almost two months! 😲<br/><br/>
        We can't just delete social media, but we can be more intentional about how we use it. Reducing screen time isn't easy and a sudden change can be jarring. The key is to make slow and gradual shifts.<br/><br/>
        <b>Here’s what worked for me:</b><br/>
        • Turn off notifications — Stops your phone from constantly grabbing your attention.<br/>
        • Use an app blocker — Limit distracting apps with Regain App, Digital Wellbeing, Screen Time.<br/>
        • Try a minimalist launcher — Hide icons to force conscious app use (Olauncher, Niagara, etc).<br/>
        • Rearrange apps regularly — Break muscle memory by moving distracting apps every few days.<br/>
        • Clean your feed — Unfollow distractions and follow accounts that inspire you.<br/>
        • Switch to grayscale — Dull the colours that make apps addictive.<br/><br/>
        The truth is: social media overuse, especially short-form content, damages our attention span and focus.<br/><br/>
        Most people wouldn’t have the patience to read this far, but you did... That means you care about your time. 👏<br/><br/>
        Thanks for reading ❤️<br/><br/>
